# PronterAuto
This is my first python project and its to automate button clicks and typing on PronterFace.
The idea is to open both notepad and pronterface to send M114 which gets XYZ data and then copy the screen and paste it on notepad.
This was to later graph those points on a 3D graph and see where it traveled.

This project was never completed because the printer we were using, wouldn't allow access to it via PronterFace so that was sad but I probaly will continue
this to make this as good as it should have been.
